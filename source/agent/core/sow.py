"""Scope of Work scoring.

Two-stage by design, following ADR 0014 in the reference sample ("deterministic
phase, no LLM"):

1. A deterministic heuristic pre-pass scans for the signals each criterion needs.
   It runs with no model, no network and no AWS account, and produces a floor
   score. This is what makes the feature testable and demonstrable offline.

2. When a model is available, a classifier refines each criterion into a 0-4
   band with a justification. The model only *classifies*; the weighted roll-up
   is arithmetic done here, so two runs over the same document cannot produce
   two different totals for the same set of bands.

If stage 2 is unavailable the result is returned with ``model_assisted=False``
and the UI labels it as heuristic-only rather than presenting it as a full score.
